# Oracle (Mock)

This directory will contain the oracle simulation for off-chain data verification (e.g., eye-tracking or engagement signals).

## For MVP
- Simulate oracle responses with static/mock data
- Interface with dashboard/extension and Anchor program as needed

## Future Work
- Integrate with real off-chain data sources
- Use Chainlink or similar for production
