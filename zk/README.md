# ZK Proofs (Mock/Circom)

This directory will contain Zero-Knowledge proof circuits or mocks for privacy-preserving attention verification.

## For MVP
- Simulate ZK proof generation and verification (can use static/mock data)
- (Optional) Integrate with Circom for real circuits

## Future Work
- Implement real ZK circuits with Circom
- Integrate with Anchor program for on-chain verification
